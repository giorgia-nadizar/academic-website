For robots with many sensors and actuators, ANNs can be very complex, with many neurons and connections. Removal of neurons or connections, i.e., pruning, may be desirable because (i) it reduces the complexity of the ANN, making its operation more energy efficient, and (ii) it might improve the generalization ability of the ANN. Whether these goals can actually be achieved in practice is however still not well known. On the other hand, it is widely recognized that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this work, we consider the case of Voxel-based Soft Robots, a kind of robots where sensors and actuators are distributed over the body and that can be controlled with ANNs optimized by means of neuroevolution. We experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on the effectiveness of neuroevolution, also in terms of generalization ability of the evolved ANNs. We find that, with some forms of pruning, a large portion of the connections can be pruned without strongly affecting robot capabilities. We also observe sporadic improvements in generalization ability."},{"n":"02","id":"nadizar2022merging","title":"Merging Pruning and Neuroevolution: towards Robust and Efficient Controllers for Modular Soft Robots","author":"G.

Pruning (removing neurons or connections) reduces the complexity of the ANN, thus increasing its energy efficiency, and has been reported to improve the generalization capability, in some cases. In addition, it is well-known that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this work, we consider the evolutionary optimization of neural controllers for the case study of Voxel-based Soft Robots, a kind of modular, bio-inspired soft robots, applying pruning during fitness evaluation. For a locomotion task, and for centralized as well as distributed controllers, we experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on after-pruning effectiveness, life-long effectiveness, adaptability to new terrains, and behavior.

In this paper, we employ a evolutionary approach to optimize the development—according to different representations—of Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs), a kind of modular robots. In our study, development consists in the addition of new voxels to the VSR, at fixed time instants, depending on the development schedule. We experiment with different schedules and show that, similarly to living organisms, artificial agents benefit from development occurring at early stages of life more than from development lasting for their entire life."},{"n":"04","id":"nadizar2022collective","title":"Collective control of modular soft robots via embodied Spiking Neural Cellular Automata","author":"G.

Within this paradigm, collective intelligence plays a key role in enabling the emerge of coordination, as each voxel is independently controlled, exploiting only the local sensory information together with some knowledge passed from its direct neighbors (distributed or collective control). In this work, we propose a novel form of collective control, influenced by Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and based on the bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks: the embodied Spiking NCA (SNCA). We experiment with different variants of SNCA, and find them to be competitive with the state-of-the-art distributed controllers for the task of locomotion.

Hence, humans play a fundamental role in relation to ALife, both as creators and as final users, which calls attention to the need of studying the mutual influence of human and artificial life. Here we attempt an experimental investigation of the reciprocal effects of the human-ALife interaction. To this extent, we design an artificial world populated by life-like creatures, and resort to open-ended evolution to foster the creatures adaptation. We allow bidirectional communication between the system and humans, who can observe the artificial world and voluntarily choose to perform positive or negative actions towards the creatures populating it; those actions may have a short- or long-term impact on the artificial creatures. Our experimental results show that the creatures are capable of evolving under the influence of humans, even though the impact of the interaction remains uncertain.

Those sub-problems are then tackled concurrently by evolving one population of solutions—actually, <i>components</i> of a larger solution—for each of them. However, components cannot be evaluated in isolation: in the common case of two concurrently evolving populations, each solution of one population must be coupled with another solution of the other population (the <i>collaborator</i>) in order to compute the fitness of the pair. Previous studies have already shown that the way collaborators are chosen and, if more than one is chosen, the way the resulting fitness measures are aggregated, play a key role in determining the success of coevolution. In this paper we perform an experimental analysis aimed at shedding new light on the effects of collaborators selection and aggregation. We first propose a general scheme for cooperative coevolution of two populations that allows to (a) different EAs and solution representations on the two sub-problems and to (b) set different collaborators selection and aggregation strategies. Second, we instantiate this general scheme in a few variants and apply it to four optimization problems with different degrees of separability: two toy problems and two real prediction problems tackled with different kinds of model (symbolic regression and neural networks). We analyze the outcomes in terms of (a) effectiveness and efficiency of the optimization and (b) complexity and generalization power of the solutions. We find that the degree to which selection and aggregation schemes differ strongly depends on the interaction between the components of the solution."},{"n":"10","id":"nadizar2023investigation","title":"An Investigation of Geometric Semantic GP with Linear Scaling","author":"G.

GSGP uses geometric semantic genetic operators, different from the standard ones, without altering the fitness, while LS modifies the fitness without altering the genetic operators. So far, these two methods have already been joined together in only one practical application. However, to the best of our knowledge, a methodological study on the pros and cons of integrating these two methods has never been performed. In this paper, we present a study of GSGP-LS, a system that integrates GSGP and LS. The results, obtained on five hand-tailored benchmarks and six real-life problems, indicate that GSGP-LS outperforms GSGP in the majority of the cases, confirming the expected benefit of this integration. However, for some particularly hard datasets, GSGP-LS overfits training data, being outperformed by GSGP on unseen data. Additional experiments using standard GP, with and without LS, confirm this trend also when standard crossover and mutation are employed. This contradicts the idea that LS is always beneficial for GP, warning the practitioners about its risk of overfitting in some specific cases."},{"n":"11","id":"nadizar2023fully","title":"A Fully-distributed Shape-aware Neural Controller for Modular Robots","author":"G.

Modularity can also enable automatic assembly and reconfiguration, be it autonomous or via external machinery. However, these procedures are error-prone and often result in misassemblings.

In this work, we address such shortcoming by proposing a shape-aware modular controller, operating with (1) <i>self-discovery</i> phase, in which each module controller identifies the shape it is assembled in, followed by (2) <i>parameter selection</i> phase, where the controller selects its parameters according to the inferred shape. We deploy a self-classifying neural cellular automaton for phase (1), and we leverage evolutionary optimization for implementing a library of controller parameters for phase (2). We test the validity of the proposed method considering voxel-based soft robots, a class of modular soft robots, and the task of locomotion. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of such a controller paradigm, and also show that it can be used to partially overcome unforeseen damages or assembly mistakes."},{"n":"12","id":"medvet2023gp","title":"GP for Continuous Control: Teacher or Learner?

We use genetic programming (GP) for solving this optimization problem. Namely, we employ a multi-tree-based GP variant, where a candidate solution is an array of m trees, each encoding a univariate function of the agent observation. We compare this form of optimization against the more common one where the controller is a multi-layer perceptron, with a predefined topology, whose weights are optimized through (neuro)evolution (NE). Moreover, we consider an evolutionary algorithm, GraphEA, that directly evolves graphs, each having n input nodes and m output nodes. We apply these three approaches to the case of simulated modular soft robots, where a robot is an aggregation of identical soft modules, each employing a controller that processes the local observation and produces the local action. We find that, in our scenario, multi-tree-based GP is competitive with NE and tends to produce different behaviors. We then experimentally investigate the possibility of optimizing a controller using another, pre-optimized one, as teacher, i.e., we realize a form of offline imitation learning. We consider all the teacher-learner pairs resulting from the three evolutionary algorithms and find that NE is a better learner than GP and GraphEA. However, controllers obtained through offline imitation learning are far less effective than those obtained through direct evolution. We hypothesize that this gap in effectiveness may be explained by the possibility, given by direct evolution, of exploring during the simulations a larger portion of the observation-action space."},{"n":"13","id":"nadizar2023neural","title":"Neural Cellular Automata Enable Self-Discovery of Physical Configuration in Modular Robots Driven by Collective Intelligence","author":"G.

One open question is what type of neural controller is most suitable for a given morphology and sensory apparatus in a given environment. One observation is that artificial neural networks with state may be able to cope with the dynamical nature of VSR bodies and their morphological computation. In this work, we consider four types of controllers, i.e., multilayer perceptrons (MLPs, stateless), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) without homeostasis, and SNNs with homeostasis. We consider three robot morphologies tested for locomotion, where each morphology is investigated in simulation with three different types and number of sensors. Neural network controllers are optimized with neuroevolution, and the experimental results are compared in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization ability. In addition, we analyze the resulting behavior of the robots systematically. Our results show that RNNs are typically more effective while MLPs are often the weakest controllers, particularly for robots with few sensors.

Despite their relevance for both theoretical and application scenarios, the design and the identification of P systems remain tedious and demanding tasks, requiring considerable time and expertise. In this work, we try to address these problems by proposing an automated methodology based on Grammatical Evolution (GE)—an evolutionary computation technique—which does not require any domain knowledge. We consider a setting where observations of successive configurations of a P system are available, and we rely on GE for automatically inferring the P system, i.e., its ruleset. Such approach directly addresses the identification problem, but it can also be employed for automated design, requiring the designer to simply express the configurations of the P system rather than its full ruleset. We assess the practicability of the proposed method on six problems of various difficulties and evaluate its behavior in terms of inference capability and time consumption. Experimental results confirm our approach is a viable strategy for small problem sizes, where it achieves perfect inference in a few seconds without any human intervention. Moreover, we also obtain promising results for larger problem sizes in a human-aided context, paving the way for fully- or partially-automated design of P systems."},{"n":"16","id":"medvet2023evolutionary","title":"Evolutionary Machine Learning in Robotics\n","author":"E.

We then survey the many usages of evolutionary computation for optimizing the morphology of the robots, including those that tackle the challenging task of optimizing the morphology and the controller at the same time.

While this freedom makes modular robots capable of performing different tasks, finding the optimal physical configuration for a given task is not trivial. In fact, practitioners attempt to jointly optimize the body and the controller of the robot for a given task, but the result is not always satisfactory. More broadly, it is not clear what factors make a physical configuration more or less successful. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and verify if humans can be predictive with respect to the performance of an optimized controller for a given robot body. We consider the case of Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs), whose rich dynamic induced by the softness of the modules makes the body particularly relevant for the robot ability to perform a task. We instantiate a number of (simulated) VSR bodies, differing in shape and actuation mechanism, and let a panel of humans control them, by means of online interaction with the simulator, while performing the task of locomotion. We use the same bodies with controllers obtained with evolutionary optimization, for the same task. We compare the ranking of human- and optimized AI-based VSRs, finding them very similar. We believe that our results strengthen the hypothesis that intrinsic factors in the body of modular robots determine their success."},{"n":"18","id":"nadizar2024naturally","title":"Naturally Interpretable Control Policies via Graph-based Genetic Programming","author":"G.

We leverage two graph-based Genetic Programming (GP) techniques—Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Linear Genetic Programming (LGP)—to develop effective yet interpretable control policies. Our experimental evaluation on eight continuous robotic control benchmarks shows competitive results compared to state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Moreover, we find that graph-based GP tends towards small, interpretable graphs even when competitive with RL. By examining these graphs, we are able to explain the discovered policies, paving the way for trustworthy AI in the domain of continuous control."},{"n":"19","id":"nadizar2024analysis","title":"An Analysis of the Ingredients for Learning Interpretable Symbolic Regression Models with Human-in-the-Loop and Genetic Programming","author":"G.

Genetic programming (GP) has been used to obtain interpretable ML models because it operates at the level of functional building blocks: if these building blocks are interpretable, there is a chance that their composition (i.e., the entire ML model) is also interpretable. However, the degree to which a model is interpretable depends on the observer. Motivated by this, we study a recently-introduced human-in-the-loop system that allows the user to steer GP’s generation process to their preferences, which shall be online-learned by an artificial neural network (ANN). We focus on the generation of ML models as analytical functions (i.e., symbolic regression) as this is a key problem in interpretable ML, and propose a two-fold contribution. First, we devise more general representations for the ML models for the ANN to learn upon, to enable the application of the system to a wider range of problems. Second, we delve into a deeper analysis of the system’s components. To this end, we propose an incremental experimental evaluation, aimed at studying the effectiveness by which an ANN can capture the perceived interpretability for simulated users,investigating how the GP’s outcome is affected across different simulated user feedback profiles, anddetermining whether humans participants would prefer models that were generated with or without their involvement.\nOur results pose clarity on pros and cons of using a human-in-the-loop approach to discover interpretable ML models with GP."},{"n":"20","id":"nadizar2024interpretable","title":"Interpretable Control of Modular Soft Robots","author":"G.

Curriculum learning (CL) has been effective in addressing similar issues across different reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but it requires the manual generation of progressively difficult test cases as well as their careful scheduling. In this work, we leverage the domain knowledge and the strong generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate effective test cases of increasing difficulties and schedule them according to various curricula. We show that by integrating a curriculum scheduler with LLM-generated test cases we can effectively train a GP agent player with environments-based curricula for a single-player game and opponent-based curricula for a multi-player game.
