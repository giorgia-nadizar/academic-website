      <p>
        I am a PhD student in Applied Data Science and Artificial
        Intelligence in the <a href="https://erallab.inginf.units.it/">"Evolutionary
        Robotics and Artificial Life Lab"</a>,
        <a href="https://www.units.it/">University of Trieste</a>.
        I earned my Bachelor and Master in Eletronics and Computer Engineering at
        the University of Trieste, in 2019 and 2021 respectively.
        I wrote my Master Thesis in collaboration with Oslo Metropolitan University,
        where I spent six months working as Research Assistant, from March to August
        2021.

        My research interests range from evolutionary robotics to artificial intelligence,
        but I am always open to explore new challenging topics.
        Currently, I am working on bio-inspired robotic controllers.
        I am interested in studying how robots can benefit from more biologically
        plausible controllers, but I also see the potential for feeding useful
        information back to neuroscience.
