      <p>
        I am a third year PhD student in Applied Data Science and Artificial
        Intelligence in the <a target="_blank" href="https://erallab.inginf.units.it/">"Evolutionary
        Robotics and Artificial Life Lab"</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.units.it/">University of Trieste</a>,
        working under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://medvet.inginf.units.it/">Prof. Eric Medvet</a>.

        My research interests lie at the intersection of embodied AI and explainable/interpretable AI.
        Namely, my goal is to find robotic controllers which can be effective while remaining directly human intelligible.
        My current approach to the problem relies on the use of different nuances of Genetic Programming,
        but I am always open to explore new paths.

        My academic journey has allowed me to experience <a target="_blank" href="/research-trips">several research environments</a>.
        At the end of 2022 I spent three months at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in Amsterdam working
        with <a target="_blank" href="https://marcovirgolin.github.io/">Dr. Marco Virgolin</a>, whereas
        in 2023, I spent five months at the ISAE-Supaero in Toulouse to work with 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://d9w.github.io/">Dr. Dennis Wilson</a>.
        More recently, at the beginning of 2024 I spent one month at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA, 
        hosted in the <a target="_blank" href="https://alfagroup.csail.mit.edu/">ALFA group</a>.
        Prior to my PhD position, I earned my Bachelor and Master in Electronics and Computer Engineering at
        the University of Trieste, in 2019 and 2021 respectively.
        During my Master Thesis, in 2021, I spent six months working as research assistant for the
        Oslo Metropolitan University with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nichele.eu/">Prof. Stefano Nichele</a>.
